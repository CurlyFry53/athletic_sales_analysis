# athletic_sales_analysis
## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step analysis of athletic sales data using Python and the pandas library. The analysis covers the combination and cleaning of sales data from 2020 and 2021, exploration of total products sold, total sales per region, and specific insights into women's athletic footwear sales.

Using groupby, Pivot table, and resample, as well as other Pandas functions, we were able to manipulate the data to show valuable information.
